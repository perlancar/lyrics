count on me

REFF:
 count on me through thick & thin
 a friendship that will never end
 when you are weak i will be strong
 helping you to carry on
 call on me i will be there
 don't be afraid
 please believe me when i say
 count on...

i can see it's hurting you
i can feel your pain
it's hard to see
the sunshine through the rain
i know sometimes it seems as if
it's never gonna end
but you'll get through it
just don't give in
cause you can...

(REFF)
you can count on me
oh yes you can

i know sometimes it seems as if
we're standing all alone
but we'll get through it
cause love won't let us fall

(REFF)

there's a place inside of all of us
where our faith in love begins
you should reach to find the truth in love
the answers there within
i know that life can make you feel
it's much harder than it really is
but we'll get through it
just don't give in

(REFF)
