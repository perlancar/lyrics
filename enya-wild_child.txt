title: WILD CHILD
artist: ENYA

ever close your eyes
ever stop and listen
ever feel alive
[that ... nothing] missing
you don't need a reason
let the day go and on

let the rain fall down
everywhere around you
give in to it now
let the day surround you
you don't need a reason
let the rain go on and on

REFF:
 what a day, what a day today to
 what a way, what a way to make it through
 what a day, what a day today to
 a wild child

only take the time
from the ...
everyday you find
everything's in kilter?
you don't need a reason
let the day go on and on

every summer sun
every winter evening?
every spring ...
every autumn leaving?
you don't need a reason
let it all go on and on

(REFF 2x)
