A:vince gill & sarah evans
T:no place that far

i can't imagine any greater fear
than waking up without you here
and though the sun would still shine on
my whole world would all be gone
but not for long

reff:
 if i had to run, if i had to crawl
 if i had to swim a hundred rivers
 just to climb a thousand walls
 always know that i will find a way
 to get to where you are
 there's no place that far

it wouldn't matter why we're apart
lonely miles or two stubborn hearts
nothing short of god above
to turn me away from your love
i need you that much
