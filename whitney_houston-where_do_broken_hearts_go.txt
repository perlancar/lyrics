where do broken hearts go

i know it's been some time
but there's something on my mind
you see, i haven't been the same
since that cold november day

we said we needed space
but all we found was an empty place
and the only things i learned
is that i need you desperately

so here i am
and can you please tell me

Reff:
 where do broken hearts go?
 can they find their way home
 back to the open arms
 of a love that's waiting there

 and if somebody loves you
 won't they always love you
 i look in your eyes
 and i know that you still care
 for me

(oo...)

i've been around and back to know
that dreams don't turn to gold
and that there is no easy way
no you can't just run away

but what we have is so much more
than we ever had before
and no matter how i try
you're always on my mind

so here i am
and can you please tell me

(reff)

and now that i am here with you
i'll never let you go
i look into your eyes
and now i know
now i know

(reff 2x)
