whitney houston & mariah carey
when you believe

many nights we prayed
with no proof anyone could hear
in our hearts our hope for song
we barely understood

now we are not afraid
although we know there's much to fear
we were moving mountains long
before we know we could

reff:
 there can be miracle
 when you believe
 though hope is frail
 it's hard to kill

 who knows what miracle
 you can achieve
 when you believe
 somehow you will

 you will when you believe

in this time of fear
when ___ so often ___ and vain
hope seed's like the summer bird
to swiftly blown away

and now i'm standing here
my heart's so full i can't explain
seeking faith and speaking words
i never thought i'd take

(reff)

they don't know what happens and you ask
and it's easy to give in to your fear
but when you blinded by your faith
has seen the way through the rain
voice ___
says love is very near
