T:i've been trying to get over you

you could've given me a million reasons why
but it wouldn't change a thing
you said it all when you said goodbye
when you took off your wedding ring

reff:
 i've been trying to get over you
 i've been spending time alone
 i've been trying to get over you
 it'll take dying to get it done

all of my friends try to fix me up
they say i need somebody new
when it comes to love ___
'cause life don't mean nothing without you

(reff)
