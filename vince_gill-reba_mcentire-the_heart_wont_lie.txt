T:the heart won't lie

looking back over the years
of all the things i've always meant to say
but the words didn't come easily
so many times through empty fields
of all the nights i've tried to pick up the phone
so scared of who might be answering

(1)
 you try to live your life from day to day
 but seeing you across the room tonight
 just gives me away

 'cause the heart won't lie
 sometimes life gets in the way
 but there's one thing that won't change
 i know, i've tried

 the heart won't lie
 you could live your alibi
 who can see you're lost inside your foolish disguise
 the heart won't lie

long after the night
will you still hear my voice through the radio
old desires make us act carelessly
long after the night
after the fire
after the scattered ashes fly
through the foreign wind blown and gone
will you come back to me

(repeat 1)
