sing your mind

many times you don't realize
the spirit within you
can spread like fire
to everyone around you

don't you wait for a second chance
you gotta use the calling
to see countless faces
that can use a little smile

unlock your power
reveal what you can really do
no more running away
today go find your way

reff:
 and sing your mind out, ooo...
 sing without doubt, ooo...
 let me hear your voice
 i wanna hear what you say
 sing your mind out, woo...

it is time that you realize
the strength you had all along
like a star shining in the sky
glowing for everyone around you

don't you wait don't you hesitate
you gotta use the time
to see countless faces
that can use a little smile

share your life
even just for a while

unlock your power
reveal what you can really do
no more running away
today go find your way

 like a star shining in the sky
 today go find your way
