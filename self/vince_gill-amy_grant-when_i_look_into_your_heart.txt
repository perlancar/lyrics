A:vince gill & amy grant
T:when i look into your heart

reff:
 when i look into your heart
 i see us holding each other
 i can finally see forever
 when i look into your heart

i've seen the moon dance on the waters
watched the morning sun slip through the trees
but the sight of you is the vision
that takes me to my knees

(reff)

i've never known such comfort
and i've never felt such release
i've never felt so connected
and i've never known such peace
