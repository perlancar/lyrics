remember those walls i built
well baby they're tumbling down
and they didn't even put up a fight
they didn't even make a sound

i found a way to let you in
but i never really had a doubt
standing in the light of your halo
i got my angel now

x:
it's like i've been awaken<>(ed)
every rule i had <to>(you) <break in>(breakin')
it's the risk that i'm taking
i ain't never gonna shut you out

<anywhere>(everywhere) i'm looking now
i'm surrounded by your embrace
baby i can see your halo
you know you're my saving grace

you're everything i need and more
it's written all over your face
baby i can feel your halo
<i>() pray it won't fade away

reff:
i <>(can) feel your halo halo halo
i <>(can) see your halo halo halo
i <>(can) feel your halo halo halo
i <>(can) see your halo halo halo
woo...

hit me like a ray of sun
burning through my darkest night
you're the only one that i want
<you got me>(think i'm) addicted to your light

i swore <i'll>(i'd) never fall again
but this don't even feel like falling
gravity can't forget
to pull me back to the ground again

(x)
