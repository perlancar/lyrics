remember those walls i built
well baby they're tumbling down
and they didn't even put up a fight
they didn't even make a sound

i found a way to let you in
but i really never had a doubt
standing in the light of your halo
i got my angel now

x:
it's like i've been awaken
every rule i had to break in
it's the risk that i'm taking
i ain't never gonna ever shut you out

anywhere i'm looking now
i'm surrounded by your embrace
baby i can see your halo
you know you're my saving grace

you're everything i need and more
it's written all over your face
baby i can feel your halo
i pray it won't fade away

reff:
i feel your halo halo halo
i see your halo halo halo
i feel your halo halo halo
i see your halo halo halo
woo...

hit me like a ray of sun
burning through my darkest night
you're the only one that i want
you got me addicted to your light

i swore i'll never fall again
but this don't even feel like falling
gravity can't forget
to pull me back to the ground again

(x)
