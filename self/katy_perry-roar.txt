roar
katy perry

i used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
[..............] the boat and make a mess
[SCARED TO ROCK]
so i [said] quietly [... lightly    ]
     [SAT ]         [AGREED POLITELY]

i guess that i forgot i had a choice
i let you push me past the breaking point
i [stick] for nothing so i [felt] for everything
  [STOOD]                  [FELL]

you held me down, but i got up
already brushing off the [desk]
                         [DUST]
you hear my voice, you hear that sound
like thunder gonna [sweep] your ground
                   [SHAKE]

you held me down, but i got up
get ready cause i've had enough
i['ve] see[n] it all, i see it now

reff:
 i got the eye of the tiger [of fire]
                            [A FIGHTER]
 dancing through the fire
 'cause i am a champion
 and you're gonna hear me roar
 louder, louder than a lion
 'cause i am a champion
 and you're gonna hear me roar
 owowo o o o o o o o o
 you're gonna hear me roar
 owowo o o o o o o o o

now i'm floating like a butterfly
stinging like a bee [........] my stripes
                    [I EARNED]
i went from ze-ero to my own he-ero

you held me down, but i got up
already brushing off the desk
you hear my voice, you hear that sound
like thunder gonna sweep your ground

you held me down, but i got up
get ready cause i've had enough
i've seen it all, i see it now
