lonely won't leave me alone
glenn medeiros

why do i seem to be
caught up inside a dream all of life
it's always been my shadow and me

over my shoulder there's
always a voice somewhere
saying i never should try to set my heart free

i wish that love would come
and take me in her arms
and show me what i've never known

where i could hold someone
and words like right and wrong
just fade away like yesterday

reff:
lonely won't leave me alone
lonely won't leave me alone
why tell me why
won't even let me fall in love
ooh... everywhere i go
always by my side
won't even let me fall in love

i tried to say i love you
but the words won't come through
when my eyes see all the tears and sad memory

why can't i start anew
and leave that old feeling too far behind
i guess that lonely needs company

around each bend of road
i'm thinking that in time
there will be that rainbow's end

but when i follow those self delusion
i find that it's only lonely me again

reff:
lonely won't leave me alone
lonely won't leave me alone
why tell me why
lonely just keeps my heart out of touch
ooh... everywhere i go
always by my side
won't even let me fall in love
