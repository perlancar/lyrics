to the left, to the left
to the left, to the left

mm...

to the left, to the left
everything you own in a box to the left
in the closet that's my stuff
yes, if i bought it then please don't touch

and cheap talking i'm nuts, that's fine
could you walk and talk at the same time
and it's my name that's on that tag
so go move your bag, let me call you a cab
sending in the front guard
telling me how i'm such a fool
talking bout how i'm never ever find a man like you

to got me to stay

reff:
you must not know 'bout me
you must not know 'bout me
i can have another you in a minute
and in fact he'll be here in a minute
baby
you must not know 'bout me
you must not know 'bout me
i can have another you by tomorrow
so don't you ever for a second get to thinking
you're irreplaceable

so go ahead and get going
call up that chick and see if she's home
oops i bet your ... that i didn't know
what did you think i was putting you out for
because you ... wasn't true

about you
baby drop them tee's
hurry up before your taxi leaves

(reff)

so i'm ... for everything
how about i'll be nothing
nothing at all to you
baby i won't shed a tear for you
i won't lose a ...
cause the truth of the matter is
replacing you is so easy
