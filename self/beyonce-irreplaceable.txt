to the left, to the left
to the left, to the left

mm...

to the left, to the left
everything you own in <a>the box to the left
in the closet that's my stuff
yes, if i bought it <then>baby please don't touch

and <cheap>keep talking <i'm nuts>that mess, that's fine
could you walk and talk at the same time
and it's my name that's on that tag
so <go move>remove your <bag>bags, let me call you a cab
<sending>standing in the front <guard>yard
telling me how i'm such a fool
talking bout how <i'm>i'll never ever find a man like you
<to got me to stay>you got me twisted

reff:
you must not know 'bout me
you must not know 'bout me
i can have another you in a minute
<and in fact>matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
baby
you must not know 'bout me
you must not know 'bout me
i can have another you by tomorrow
so don't you ever for a second get to thinking
you're irreplaceable

so go ahead and get <going>gone
call up that chick and see if she's home
oops i bet <your ...>you thougt that i didn't know
what did you think i was putting you out for
because you <... wasn't true>was untrue
<>rolling her around in the car that i bought you
baby drop them <tee's>keys
hurry up before your taxi leaves

(reff)

<so i'm ... for everything>so since i'm not your everything
how about i'll be nothing
nothing at all to you
baby i won't shed a tear for you
i won't lose a <...>wink of sleep
cause the truth of the matter is
replacing you is so easy
