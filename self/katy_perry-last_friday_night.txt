last friday night

there's a stranger in my bed
there's a pounding in my head
glitter all over the room
pink flamingo('s)[s] in the pool

i smell like a minibar
(TJ's)[DJ's] passed out in the yard
barbie's on the barbeque
this a hickey or a bruise?

pictures of last night ended up online
i'm screwed, oh well
it's a blacked out blur
but i'm pretty sure it ruled
damn

reff:
 last friday night
 (yeow)[yeah] we (did some)[danced on] table( )[]tops
 (down? we ticked?)[and we took] too many shots
 think we kissed but i forgot

 last friday night
 (yeow)[yeah] we maxed our credit cards
 (ended)[and got] kicked out of the bar
 so we hit the (pool at bar)[boulevard]

 last friday night
 we went streaking in the park
 skinny-dipping in the dark
 then had a menage-a-trois

 last friday night
 yeow i think we broke the law
 always say we're gonna stop op oh wow

 this friday night
 do it all again

 this friday night
 do it all again

(lying through)[trying to] connect the dots
don't know what to tell my boss
think the city (... the cop)[towed my car]
chandelier is on the floor

(with)[ripped] my favorite party dress
warrant's out for my arrest
think i need a ginger ale
(got ...)[that was such an] epic fail

pictures of last night ended up online
i'm screwed, oh well
it's a blacked out blur
but i'm pretty sure it ruled
damn
