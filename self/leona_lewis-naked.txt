he could have left me on a friday
would've loved to at least have the weekend
to go under and to stay under [](to)
to get better and to stay better

[did](but) you [have](had) to [took](pick) a monday
now i[]('ve) gotta go to work
and get through [fine? day](five days)
to get through it, i can't do it, no i can't do it

reff:
there's a [hard breaking](heartbreaking) chill running through my bones
got my clothes but i can't really feel them on
oh no, whatever i do, i'm naked, i'm naked without you
can't go out, can't go home, can't go anywhere
[...](covered up) but i'm still watching people [stay](stare)
oh no, now what can i do, i'm naked, i'm naked without you

tried to focus, to go unnoticed
but the harder i [tried ... wait](try to stay dry, it rains)
and i can't do it, no [i](they) see through [](it), yeah
[i](they) see through it

(reff)

inside i'm still [hurting](hiding)
outside i'm just too exposed
i know that i should let go

[hope that](but) i [...](miss) you
