he could've left me on a friday
would've loved to at least have the weekend
to go under and to stay under
to get better and to stay better

did you have to took a monday
now i gotta go to work
and get through fine? day
get through it, i can't do it, no i can't do it

reff:
there's a hard breaking chill running through my bones
got my clothes but i can't really feel them on
oh no, whatever i do, i'm naked, i'm naked without you
can't go out, can't go home, can't go anywhere
... but i'm still watching people stay
oh no, now what can i do, i'm naked, i'm naked without you

tried to focus, to go unnoticed
but the harder i tried ... wait
and i can't do it, no i see through, yeah
i see through it

(reff)
