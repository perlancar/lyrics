when your legs don't work like they used to before
and i can't sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
will your eyes still smile from your cheek[s]

darling i will be loving you till we're seventy
and baby my heart could still (pull? as heart at)[fall as hard at] twenty-three
and i'm thinking 'bout people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand

well me (i'm full)[i fall] in love with your every single day
and i just wanna tell you i am

reff:
so honey now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your hand on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
maybe we found love right where we are

when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds don't remember my name
when my hands don't (... strength)[play the strings] the same way, umm
i know you will still love me the same

cause honey your sould could never grow old, it's evergreen
and baby your smile's forever in my mind in memory
i'm thinking 'bout people fall in love in mysterious ways
and maybe it's [all] part of a plan
well i'll just keep on making the same mistake
hoping that you'll understand

reff:
(...)[that] baby now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your hand on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
maybe we found love right where we are
