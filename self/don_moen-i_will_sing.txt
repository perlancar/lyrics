hear our prayer
we are your children
and we've gathered here today
we've gathered here to pray

hear our cry
lord we need your mercy
and we need your grace today
hear us as we pray

 reff:
 our father who art in heaven
 hallowed be thy name
 our father hear us from heaven
 forgive our sins we pray

hear our song
as it rises to heaven
may your glory fill the earth
as the waters cover the sea

see our hearts
and remove anything
that is standing in the way
of coming to you today

 (reff)

though we are few
we're surrounded by many
who have crossed that river before
and this is the song
we'll be singing forever
holy is the lord (8x)
