whitney houston & mariah carey
when you believe

many nights we prayed
with no proof anyone could hear
in our hearts a hope for a song
we barely understood

now we are not afraid
although we know there's much to fear
we were moving mountains
long before we know we could

reff:
 there can be miracle
 when you believe
 though hope is frail
 it's hard to kill

 who knows what miracle
 you can achieve
 when you believe
 somehow you will

 you will when you believe

in this time of fear
when prayer so often proves in vain
hope seems like the summer bird
too swiftly flown away

yet now i'm standing here
my heart's so full i can't explain
seeking faith and speaking words
i never thought i'd say

(reff)

they don't always happen when you ask
and it's easy to give in to your fears
but when you're blinded by your pain
can't see the way, get through the rain
a small but still, resilient voice
says hope is very near
