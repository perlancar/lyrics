remember the first day when i saw you face
remember the first day when you smiled at me
you stepped to me and then you said to me
i was the woman you dreamed about

remember the first day when you <caught my blouse>(called my house)
remember the first day when you took me out
we had butterflies although we tried to hide it
and we both had a beautiful night

x:
the way we held each other's hand
the way we talked the way we laughed
it felt so good to find true love
i knew <...>(right then and there that) you're the one

reff:
i know that he loved me cause he told me so
i know that he loved me cause his feelings show
when he<'s>( stares at me) you see he cares for me
you see how's he's so deep in love

i know that he loves me cause it's obvious
i know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
and he's missing me if he's not kissing me
and when he looks at me his brown eyes tell <it so>(his soul)

remember the first day the first day we kissed
remember the first day when we had an argument
we apologized and the we compromised
and we haven't argued since

remember the first day we stopped playing games
remember the first day you fell in love with me
it felt so good for you to say those words
cause i felt the same way too

(x)

and baby now that you're a part of me
you showed me
showed me the true meaning of love
and i know he loves me
