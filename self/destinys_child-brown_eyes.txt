remember the first day when i saw you face
remember the first day when you smiled at me
you stepped to me and then you said to me
i was the woman you dreamed about

remember the first day when you caught my blouse
remember the first day when you took me out
we had butterflies although we tried to hide it
and we both had a beautiful night

x:
the way we held each other's hand
the way we talked the way we laughed
it felt so good to find true love
i knew ... you're the one

reff:
i know that he loved me cause he told me so
i know that he loved me cause his feeling showed
when he's you see he cares for me
you see how's he's so deep in love

i know that he loves me cause it's obvious
i know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
and he's missing me if he's not kissing me
and when he looks at me his brown eyes tell it so

remember the first day the first day we kissed
when i say you face
remember the first day when we had an argument
we apologized and the we compromised
we haven't argued since

remember the first day we stopped playing games
remember the first day you fell in love with me
it felt so good for you to say those words
cause i felt the same way too

(x)

now that you're a part me
