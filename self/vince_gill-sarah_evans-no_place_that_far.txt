A:vince gill & sarah evans
T:no place that far
ID:ke mana jua

i can't imagine any greater fear
than waking up without you here
and though the sun would still shine on
my whole world would all be gone
but not for long

     tak terbayangkan bila suatu hari
     kau tak ada di sisi
     walau mentari trus bersinar
     duniaku tlah buyar
     kan tetapi

reff:
 if i had to run, if i had to crawl
 if i had to swim a hundred rivers
 just to climb a thousand walls
 always know that i will find a way
 to get to where you are
 there's no place that far

         ku kan berlari, tak kan berhenti
         kan kusebrangi seratus sungai
         panjat sribu dinding
         yakinlah ku kan mencarimu
         sampai kutemu
         ke mana jua
 
it wouldn't matter why we're apart
lonely miles or two stubborn hearts
nothing short of god above
to turn me away from your love
i need you that much

    berjauhan takkan lama
    jarak tak ada artinya
    hanyalah yang kuasa
    yang sanggup pisahkan
    kita berdua
