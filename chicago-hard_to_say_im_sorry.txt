everybody needs a little time away
i had to say from each other
even lovers need a holiday
far away from each other

(1):
 hold me now
 it's hard for me to say i'm sorry
 i just want you to stay

(2):
 after all that we've been through
 i will make it up to you
 i promised to

 and after all that's been said and done
 you're just a part of me
 i can't let go

(ooo...)

couldn't stand and be kept away
just for the day, from your body
wouldn't wanna be swept away
far away from the one that i love

(repeat 1: stay -> know)

 hold me now
 i really want to tell you i'm sorry
 i could never let you go

(repeat 2)
(repeat 2a)

you... gonna be the lucky one
