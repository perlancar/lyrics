i remember all my life
raining down as cold as ice
shadows of a man
a face through window
crying in the night
the night goes into...

morning just another day
happy people pass my way
looking in their eyes
i see a memory
i never realized
how happy you made me

reff:
 oh mandy
 well(?) you came and you gave without taking
 but i sent you away
 oh mandy
 will you kiss me and stop me from shaking
 and i need you today
 oh mandy

standing on the edge of time
i've walked away when love was mine
caught up in the world of uphill climbing
the tears are in my mind
and nothing is riving(?)

(reff)

yesterday's a dream
i've faced the morning
crying on a breeze
the pain is calling

(reff 2x)
