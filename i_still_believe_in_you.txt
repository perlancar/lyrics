i still believe in you

everybody wants a little piece of time
but still i put you at the end of the line
how it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
to see the tears you cry falling like rain

give me the chance to prove
and i'll make it up to you

REFF:
 i still believe in you
 with the love that will always be
 standing so strong and true
 baby i still believe in you and me

somewhere along the way i guess i just lost track
only thinking of myself, never looking back 
for all the times i've hurt you i apologize
i'm sorry it took so long to finally realize
give me the chance to prove
that nothing's worth losing you

(REFF)
