T:when i look into your heart

reff:
 when i look into your heart
 i see us holding each other
 i could finally see forever
 when i look into your heart

i've seen the moon dance on the water
i've watched the morning sun slipped through the trees
with the sight of you it's the patience
it takes me to my knees

(reff)

i've never known such comfort
and i've never felt such relieve
i've never felt so ___
and i've never known such peace
