THAT'S THE WAY IT IS

i can read your mind
and i know your story
i see what you're going through, yeah
it's an up-hill climb
and i'm feeling sorry
but i know it will come to you, yeah

don't surrender
cause you can win
in this thing called love

reff:

when you want it the most
there's no easy way out
when you're ready to go
and your heart's left in doubt
don't give up on your faith
love comes to those who believe it
and that's the way it is

when you question me
for a simple answer
i don't know what to say (no)
but it's plain to see
if you stick together
you're gonna find the way

so don't surrender
cause you can win
in this thing called love

(reff)

when life is empty
with no tomorrow
and loneliness starts to call
baby don't worry
forget your sorrow
this love's gonna conquer it all

(reff)
