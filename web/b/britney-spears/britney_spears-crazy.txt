Baby, I'm so into you 
You got that somethin, what can I do 
Baby, you spin me around 
The Earth is movin, but I can't feel the ground 


Every time you look at me 
My heart is jumpin, it's easy to see 


You drive me crazy 
I just cant sleep 
Im so excited, I'm in too deep 
Ohh...crazy, but it feels alright 
Baby, thinkin of you keeps me up all night 


Tell Me, you're so into me 
That i'm the only one you will see 
Tell me, i'm not in the blue 
That i'm not wastin, my feelings on you 


You drive me crazy 
I just cant sleep 
Im so excited, I'm in too deep 
Ohh...crazy, but it feels alright 
Baby, thinkin of you keeps me up all night 


Crazy, I just can't sleep 
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep 
Crazy, But it feels alright 
Every Day and Every Night 


You drive me crazy 
I just cant sleep 
Im so excited, I'm in too deep 
Ohh...crazy, but it feels alright 
Baby, thinkin of you keeps me up all night 


You Drive Me Crazy (You drive me crazy baby) 
Ohh..Crazy, But It Feels Alright 
Baby Thinkin of you keeps me up all night 
Baby Thinkin of you keeps me up all night
