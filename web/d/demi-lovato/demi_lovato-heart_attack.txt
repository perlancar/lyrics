"Heart Attack"

 Puttin’ my defences up
 ‘Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
 If I ever did that
 I think I’d have a heart attack

 Never put my love out on the line
 Never said yes to the right guy
 Never had trouble getting what I want
 But when it comes to you, I’m never good enough

 When I don’t care
 I can play ‘em like a Ken doll
 Won’t wash my hair
 Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

 But you make me wanna act like a girl
 Paint my nails and wear high heels
 Yes, you make me so nervous
 And I just can’t hold your hand

 You make me glow, but I cover up
 Won’t let it show, so I’m

 Puttin’ my defences up
 'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
 If I ever did that
 I think I’d have a heart attack [x3]

 Never break a sweat for the other guys
 When you come around, I get paralyzed
 And every time I try to be myself
 It comes out wrong like a cry for help

 It's just not fair
 Pain's more trouble than love is worth
 I gasp for air
 It feels so good, but you know it hurts

 But you make me wanna act like a girl
 Paint my nails and wear perfume
 For you make me so nervous
 And I just can’t hold your hand

 You make me glow, but I cover up
 Won’t let it show, so I’m

 Puttin’ my defences up
 'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
 If I ever did that
 I think I’d have a heart attack [x3]

 The feelings are lost in my lungs
 They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
 And there’s no one else to blame
 So scared I take off in a run
 I’m flying too close to the sun
 And I burst into flames

 You make me glow, but I cover up
 Won’t let it show, so I’m

 Puttin’ my defences up
 ‘Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
 If I ever did that
 I think I’d have a heart attack [x5]
