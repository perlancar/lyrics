Sometimes the snow comes down in june
 sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
 I see the passion in your eyes
 sometimes It's all a big surprise
 'cause there was a time when all I did was wish
 you'd tell me this was love
 It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
 but some how it's enough

 and now we're standing face to face 
 Isn't this world a crazy place
 just when I thought our chance had passed
 you go and save the best for last

 all of the nights you came to me
 when some silly girl had set you free
 you wondered how you'd make it through
 I wondered what was wrong with you
 'cause how could you give your love to someone else
 and share your dreams with me
 sometimes the very thing you're looking for
 is the one thing you can't see

 but now we're standing face to face
 Isn't this world a crazy place
 just when I thought our chance had passed
 you'd go and save the best for last

 sometimes the very thing you're looking for
 is the one thing you can't see
 sometimes the snow comes down in june
 sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
 just when I thought our chance had passed
 you'd go and save the best for last
 you went and saved the best for last
