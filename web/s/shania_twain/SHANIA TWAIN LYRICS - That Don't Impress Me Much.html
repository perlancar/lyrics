<B>"That Don't Impress Me Much"</b><BR>
<BR>
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart<br>
But you've got being right down to an art<br>
You think you're a genius-you drive me up the wall<br>
You're a regular original, a know-it-all<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else<br>
<br>
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist<br>
That don't impress me much<br>
So you got the brain but have you got the touch<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright<br>
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night<br>
That don't impress me much<br>
<br>
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket<br>
And a comb up his sleeve-just in case<br>
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it<br>
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place<br>
<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else<br>
<br>
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt<br>
That don't impress me much<br>
So you got the looks but have you got the touch<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright<br>
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night<br>
That don't impress me much<br>
<br>
You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine<br>
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in<br>
I can't believe you kiss your car good night<br>
C'mon baby tell me-you must be jokin', right!<br>
<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else<br>
<br>
Okay, so you've got a car<br>
That don't impress me much<br>
So you got the moves but have you got the touch<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright<br>
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night<br>
<br>
That don't impress me much<br>
You think you're cool but have you got the touch<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright<br>
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night<br>
That don't impress me much<br>
<br>
Okay, so what do you think you're Elvis or something...<br>
Oo-Oh-Oh<br>
That don't impress me much!<br>
<br>
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-No<br>
Alright! Alright!<br>
<br>
You're Tarzan!<br>
Captain Kirk maybe.<br>
John Wayne.<br>
Whatever!<br>
That don't impress me much!<br>
