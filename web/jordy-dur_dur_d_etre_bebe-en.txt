It's really hard to be a baby!

It’s really hard to be a baby,
Oh la la, baby, it’s hard to be a baby
Oh la la, baby, it’s hard to be a baby
So hard to be a baby

My name is Jordy,
I’m four years old and I am small,
It’s hard to be a baby, it’s hard to be a baby!

Come here, don’t touch that,
Keep seated, don’t go there,
Do like this, do like that,
“Patati and patata!”

Why this, why that,
Why is it like this?
Why this, why that,
Why is it like that?

Oh la la, baby, it’s hard to be a baby
Oh la la, baby, it’s hard to be a baby
So hard to be a baby

And, Mummy, what are you saying?
(Go to) sleep, brush your teeth,
Keep your fingers out of your nose,
Don’t do this, don’t do that,
"Patati and patata!"

Why this, why that,
Why is it like this?
Why this, why that,
Why is it like that?

Keep seated, I disagree!
Don’t touch that, I disagree!
Don’t go there, I disagree!
You won’t get a dessert,
And Grandma, and Grandpa and Mummy,
It’s so hard to be a baby

Oh la la, baby, it’s hard to be a baby
Oh la la, baby, it’s hard to be a baby
So hard to be a baby
