i left on time
 i took the train
 in the direction of the heart
 i didnt see the train
 who was going to fast
 u leave me
 a second class girl
 took my place

every time my train leaves the rails
 im not at good height
 everytime my heart leaves the railles
 and my head , surprisely , my life doesnt have a tail nor a head
 every time my train leaves the rails
 rushes into cotton
 everytime my heart leaves the railles
 and my head , surprisely , my life doesnt have a tail nor a head

 and what do we do
 we take the next one
 on the other pier
 our body these big traverlers
 roll yes but
 yes , but jump of humour
 without stopping

 every time my train leaves the rails
 im not at good height
 every time my heart leaves the rails
 and my head , surprisely , my life doesnt have a tail nor a head
 every time my train leaves the rails
 rushes into cotton
 every time my heart leaves the rails

 every time men leaves the rails
 and starts battle
 every time men leaves the rails
 and starts battle

 and why?
 yes why?
 it bangs and it hurts
 and it feels the end of pain

 oh but why men leave the rails?
 and go for the battle
 Say why men leave the rails
 its a fact, surprise , life has not tail no head,
 thats why the world leaves the rails
 and death at the battle

 but why the world leaves the rails.
 and it bangs and it bleeds.
 and it feels the end of pain
 its a fact, surprise, life has no tail no head.
