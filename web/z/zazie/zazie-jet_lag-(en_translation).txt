I don't know where I'm going, where I am
 Jet lag, jet lag
 When I'm taking off, when I'm landing
 Jet lag, jet lag
 If I gain an hour
 If I lose an hour

But so that our loves in transit don't arrive too quickly at the end of the voyage
 I live always in the lag to traverse the ages without [leaving?]

At sea, I love you [embraced?] but there must not be waves
 Jet lag, jet lag,
 I invite myself to every country and every language
 Jet lag, jet lag

One can change times
 Without changing heart
 And so that this life in transit doesn't arrive too quickly at the end of the voyage
 Before the forces leave me
 I fly suspended in this crazy race
 I fly to not be nailed to the ground
 We fly like we're fleeing, when the forces leave us at the end of the voyage
 To live again like a mirage
 We fly suspended in this crazy race
 We fly to not be nailed to the ground
 We fly, gliding still a little bit farther
 We fly/steal [double entendre I think] another hour before the end
