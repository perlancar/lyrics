Duo

[Zazie]
 Yes
 I feel the wind
 I feel the rain
 Feel the pain

The blood that flows in my veins
 Continues its journey
 I am my own

And it's so easy to live
 And it's so easy to live
 And it's easier to live
 To love you

[Paolo Nutini]
 Well it's true
 I feel the wind
 I feel the rain
 I feel the pain
 I feel the shame

Same blood running through my veins
 Same beating heart
 One for each mind

And it's so easy to live
 And it's so easy to live
 And it's so easy to love
 Why don't we

[Zazie and Paolo Nutini]
 We keep on running on we
 From now i'm running away

Life means nothing at all
 If I don't fall
 In love with you
