Flower Power

You aren't ready still(again)
 Yes, weep
 Happiness vanishes
 And dies
 To be reborn, alive

As heavy as sleep as the sun
 As low as it is, we will rise
 Life is so hard, she is beautiful too
 For many a heart is heavy
 As it still beats

Your heart
 Our lost paradise
 Sweetness
 In our defended(forbbiden) bodies
 Is allowed
 Our scrap(damaged) joys
 Are immersed
 To resurface

As heavy as sleep as the sun
 As low as it is, we will rise
 Life is so hard, she is beautiful too
 For many a heart is heavy
 As it still beats

Whoa, open your eyes
 Whoa, open your eyes

And behold, the time after the rain
 You see, we will return everything
 Believe me, if the love is gone
 Tell yourself that love is everywhere
