Totem Pole

A heart
 Stone
 My hands
 On him
 Deteriorate
 Bleeding
 Towering(looming) like a totem pole

I sculpt
 I size
 I invent
 This man
 Who loves me
 Who loves me

Stronger
 Still(Again)
 Taller
 The body
 Harder
 Warmer
 My soul
 of Squaw
 Shapes
 That man
 That I dreamed up

Caress
 The idea
 Towering(looming) like a totem pole

I scuplt
 I size
 A temple to the man that I love...
 That I love

Still(Again)
 I pray for
 I expect(wait for)
 The life
 Of the spirit
 Of the wind
 To penetrate
 Me

Life
 Can be
 Towering(looming) like a totem pole

I scuplt
 I size
 I breath for the man that I love 

Finally ...
 Come ...
 Come ...
 Come ...
 Come...
