The stars were spinning.
 I made a vow that we would be
 Happy, though it isn't
 True.

While I'm sleeping, on the other hand,
 I sort myself out,
 I make angels out of us.
 ...
 Where we love each other,
 Where nobody can bother us.

And I close my eyes to the world,
 You take on my shadows,
 In the space of a second,
 Our dreams are merged

And I...*
 And I love you*
 I don't give a damn what they say.
 I dream, therefore I am.

To see men copping out,
 Like vows that aren't fulfilled
 ...
 We're missing a heart and it's weighing us down
 To bursting
 Yet I wait for night to fall,
 In the dark
 The despair is allowed.
 I'm infinitely faithful to you
 That's enough for me

And I...*
 And I love you*
 I know very well what you say,
 You don't love me*
 You don't love me*
