It hurts and it doesn't matter

 How many words are there in the sentence
 We throw it at each other's face
 How many flowers are there in the vase
 To heal the wound
 How many battles, one too many,
 How many hubristic egos
 We are two real idiots

 For each time we leave each other
 We end up coming back to each other one day
 Every time we let go of each other
 We end up holding each other one day
 Which just goes to show we'd better take
 Life as it comes
 It hurts and it doesn't matter

 How many words that hurt
 And inappropriate gestures
 How many mistakes, how much dirty laundry,
 How many pieces to the puzzle
 How many useless wars
 Do we still have to declare
 We are two fools
 For each time we leave each other
 We end up coming back to each other one day
 Every time we let go of each other
 We end up holding each other one day
 Which just goes to show we'd better take
 Life as it comes
 It hurts and it doesn't matter
 It doesn't matter
 Each time we leave each other
 We end up coming back to each other
 Each time we forget
 We end up remembering one day
 Each time we let go of each other
 We end up holding each other
 Which goes to show we'd better
 Take life as it comes
 It hurts and it doesn't matter
 It hurts and it doesn't matter
 It hurts and it doesn't matter
