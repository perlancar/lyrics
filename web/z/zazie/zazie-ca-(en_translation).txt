That

We forget adresses
 Like we forget the ones who hurt us
 We forget constantly
 Birthdays and our keys, marks, we lose them
 We'll forget the chains of our lives that drag behind
 We forget anyhow
 But there's one thing we'll be loyal to

The eyes, the voice, the hands, the words of love, it will still be there,
 The day and the time, the skin, the smell, the love will still be there,
 It's still strong
 It's dead, okay
 But it won't be forgotten
 Won't be forgotten, that
 We don't forget

I'll forget that august when I had to go along without you,
 Without a doubt
 I'll forget my defeat and the dream that stops
 Maybe I'll forget
 But I still think about it sometimes, and I cannot explain
 It's inexplicable

Your eyes, your voice, your hands touching me, that will be always there,
 The day and the time, your skin, the smell, the love will still be there,
 It's still strong
 It's dead, okay
 But it won't be forgotten
 Won't be forgotten, that
 I don't forget

The eyes, the voice, your hands touching me, the words of love, it will still be there,
 The day and the time, the skin, the smell, the love, it's there
 We don't forget

The eyes, the voice, your hands touching me, the words of love
 It will stay there
 We don't forget
 It won't be forgotten

The day and the time, the skin, the smell, the love is there
 We don't forget
 It won't be forgotten

The eyes, the voice, your hands touching me, the words of love
 It will stay there
 We don't forget
 I will not forget you

The day and the time, the skin, the smell, the love, it's there
 We don't forget
 I will never forget you
