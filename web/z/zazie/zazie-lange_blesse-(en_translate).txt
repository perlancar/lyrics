The Wounded Angel

For our dreams (that fell from the heavens) (flabbergasted)
 Drowned in the rain of lost time
 Our icy hearts that break
 Of wars, so weary, so weary

I pray to the gods, me who doesn't believe in anyone
 I pray to the gods yet believe in this man
 For this wounded angel
 I pray to heaven
 Give him back his wings

For our bloodied souls
 Having found
 At the treshold of our lives
 closed doors
 For us, poor fools
 Is there a life
 Even before death?

I pray to the gods, me who doesn't believe in anyone
 I pray to the gods yet believe in this man
 For this wounded angel
 I pray to heaven
 Give him back his wings

I pray to the gods, me, who believes in nothing
 I pray to the gods to reach out a hand
 For this angel, almost dead, I implore you all
 For he loves still(again)
 He loves still(again)
 For he loves still(again)
 He loves me still(again), still(again), still(again), still(again)
