Seen from Heaven
Versions: #1#2

I am a tomboy
 Who knows how to play with dolls
 I can change roles whenever
 At risk of losing control

I see myself lying on my back
 My sole at rest
 And I send up into the air, the whole universe
 That our lives are beautiful
 Seen from heaven
 Seen from heaven
 Seen from heaven
 Life is beautiful

A man just set down
 On the moon, his rocket
 To come, he traveled so so far
 It's my turn to go up there

I see him lying on his back
 His soul at rest
 And I send up into the air, the whole universe
 That this man is beautiful
 Seen from heaven
 Seen from heaven
 Seen from heaven
 Life is beautiful

I'm a tomboy
 Who will finish in beauty
