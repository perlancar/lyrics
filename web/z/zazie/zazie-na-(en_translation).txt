Who pilfered my briefcase, who ate all my candies?
 Who slept in my bed
 And who deceived me immediately?
 Who, it's who told me everything's finished, not me I regret
 It's the one who says, who is

(refrain)
 Na na [etc]
 Don't go telling me that that's happiness
 I've already known the worst as well as the best

Who is happy in love, go on, I'm waiting, raise a finger
 Who's knows who's still waiting, not me, but yes it is me!
 Who only has eyes to cry

(refrain)

But who would like an angry girl
 Who lost all her men to war?
 The spell only works on an open heart, open

But who will soon find herself all alone in front of her TV
 Single, knows all about what to do to get noticed
 Who, it's who goes and shouts on the rooftops, "LOVE ME!"
 It's the one who shouts, who is

Na na [etc]
 Don't go and tell me that that's happiness
 When we've lived the worst we want the best
