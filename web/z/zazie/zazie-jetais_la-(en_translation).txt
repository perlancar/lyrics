I was there, you see him standing next to me
 we were six years old
 We played doctor, doctor like kids
 I was there, I saw the bruises, the scars
 I couldn't believe my eyes
 my eyes
 And he told me I was tough
 You see, the burns on my arms
 I don't feel them
 I don't feel them
 I was there, I didn't say anything
 And then I left his house
 If I had returned there
 Never again
 Never again
 I was there like him, I was barely 15
 We were in the basement in his parents' house
 I loved him so much
 it has to be said he was handsome, but he took heroin, my hero
 I was there when his mother came to tell me
 It's over, the funeral's on monday
 monday
 I cried, of course I cried
 But then I went outside again
 outside
 I was there, October 8th after the bomb (copernick)
 Yes, I was at the manifestation
 With all my friends
 I was there, it's true, although I didn't understand a thing of it
 But we thought it was okay
 Okay
 Yes I was there to help people with aids and the homeless
 I sang
 Sang
 Of course I was there to celebrate
 And I raised my glass to them who lost everything
 One more glass, we couldn't help it
 I was there watching TV at 8 pm
 I've seen the world agitate
 agitate
 I was just there when I came back from Somalia, Bangladesh and Rouanda
 I was there
 I've seen the fate North keeps for South
 Who got the contempt! I was there to count de dead
 I was there and I didn't do anything
 and I didn't do anything
 Still I was there
 I was there and I didn't do anything
