I am a caveman
 I am an ape or a fish
 On the earth, all year round,
 I run in circles, I run in circles

I am only one, then millions
 I am a man with a lion heart
 At war, all year round,
 I run in circles, I run in circles

I am a man full of ambitions
 Nice car and nice house
 In the bedroom, in the living room
 I run in circles, I run in circles

I make love and revolution
 I analyze the facts of the matter
 I go forth, go forth backwards
 I run in circles, I run in circles

You see, I'm not a man
 I am the king of illusion
 At heart, may I be forgiven,
 I am the king, the king of fools

I've made the world my way
 Cast in gold and concrete
 Caged body and prisoned heart
 I run in circles, I run in circles

Sitting in front of my television
 I am the negation of man
 Pure convenience goods
 I've had it, I've had it

You see, I'm not a man
 I am the king of illusion
 At heart, may I be forgiven,
 I am the king, the king of fools

I control fire, I control the game
 I control the world, and behold what I've done with it
 A frozen land, a scorched land
 The land of men that men forsake!

I am a man with his back to the wall
 Like a freak of nature
 On the earth, with no other reason
 I run in circles, I run in circles

I am a man and I consider
 All the horror of my nature
 For my trouble, my punishment
 I run in circles, I run in circles
