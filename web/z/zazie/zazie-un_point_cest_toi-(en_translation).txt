Strip yourself naked, if you are a man. Just to see where we are. Give me a primate. Without a tie. A Zorro. With nothing on your back... you are so much more beautiful like this. That's all. You are all. I love you like this. That's all. You are all. Free of pretending. Where is the vice... remove your grip. If you are a man. Who can do more. Who can do the minimum. And like this. You remain the weakness. Of my heart. And I am the mistress. In your own home... you are much more male like this. That's all. You are all. I love you like this. That's all. You are all. Without above or below. And then it's everything. And it's like this... we can expect that your savage states. Will do less damage. Than your peacock feathers. When you Tarzan. I like it. When you take after Adam. I take after you. That's all. You are all... I love you like this. That's all. You are all. Without anything at all. Without anything of you. That's all.
