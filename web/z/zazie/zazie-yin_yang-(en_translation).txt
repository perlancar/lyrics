Yin Yang

What to say to those who see me
 Burst into tears, Roaring with laughing
 It will, it will not
 Whatever the wind will turn

What to say to those who believe me
 Unable to run straight
 Slaloming* belongs to humanity
 I delight in all my states

It's Yin it's Yang
 It's Yin it's Yang

I tell anyone who will listen
 That girl is a heart to take
 I have the Big Bang on the tip of the tongue
 I have the world at my fingertips

No matter what you will say
 Murky(troubled) waters I hang out down there
 That's how life is with me
 I bathe myselft there like(as) I drown there 

It's Yin it's Yang
 It's Yin it's Yang

This is ta ta ta...(This yours, yours, yours)

It's Yin it's Yang
 It's Yin it's Yang

Yin Yang,
 King Kong,
 Big Bang,
 Gang Bang

Yin Yang...
