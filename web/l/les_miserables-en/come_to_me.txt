[Fantine is lying in a hospital bed, deliriously dreaming of her daughter Cosette.] 

Fantine
Cosette, it's turned so cold
Cosette, it's past your bedtime
You've played the day away
And soon it will be night.
Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading
Don't you see the evening star appearing?
Come to me, and rest against my shoulder
How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder.
Hurry near, another day is dying
Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying?
There's a darkness which comes without a warning
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning. 

[Valjean enters.] 

Valjean
Oh, Fantine, our time is running out
But Fantine, I swear this on my life 

Fantine
Look, M'sieur, where all the children play 

Valjean
Be at peace, be at peace evermore. 

Fantine
My Cosette... 

Valjean
Shall live in my protection 
[ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/come-to-me-fantines-death-lyrics-les-miserables.html ]

Fantine
Take her now 

Valjean
Your child will want for nothing 

Fantine
Good M'sieur, you come from God in Heaven. 

Valjean
And none will ever harm Cosette
As long as I am living. 

Fantine
Take my hand,
The night grows ever colder. 

Valjean
Then I will keep you warm. 

Fantine
Take my child, I give her to your keeping. 

Valjean
Take shelter from the storm 

Fantine
For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping
And tell Cosette I love her
And I'll see her when I wake... 

[She dies with a smile; Javert arrives.]
