Drinkers:
 Come on, you old pest!
 Fetch a bottle of your best!
 What's the nectar of the day?

 Thenardier:
 Here try this lot
 Guaranteed to hit the spot
 Or I'm not Thenardier!

 Drinkers:
 Give us a glass of rum!
 Landlord over here!

 Thenardier:
 Right away you scum,
 Right away Monsieur!

 Drinkers:
 God, this place has gone to hell
 So you tell me every year!
 Mine host, Thenardier
 He was there, so they say
 At the field of Waterloo,
 Got there, it's true
 When the fight was all through
 But he knew just what to do!
 Crawling through the mud, so I've heard it said
 Picking through the pockets of the English dead
 He made a tidy score from the spoils of war!

 Thenardier:
 My band of soaks, my den of dissolute's
 My dirty jokes, my always pissed as newts
 My sons of whores spend there lives in my inn,
 Homing pigeons homing in
 They fly through my doors,
 And their money's good as yours!

 Drinkers:
 Ain't got a clue what he put into this stew,
 Must've scraped it off the street.
 God what a wine, Chateauneuf du Terpentine,
 Must've pressed it with his feet!
 Landlord over here
 Where's the bloody man?
 One more for the road,
 One more slug of gin!
 Just one more or my old man is gonna do me in...

 Thenardier:
 Welcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down
 And meet the best innkeeper in town
 As for the rest, all of 'em crooks:
 Rooking their guests and crooking the books
 Seldom do you see 
 Honest men like me
 A gent of good intent
 Who's content to be

 Master of the house, doling out the charm
 Ready with a handshake and an open palm
 Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
 Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
 Glad to do a friend a favor
 Doesn't cost me to be nice
 But nothing gets you nothing
 Everything has got a little price!

 Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
 Ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two
 Watering the wine, making up the weight
 Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
 Everybody loves a landlord
 Everybody's bosom friend
 I do whatever pleases
 Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!

 Thenardier & Drinkers:
 Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye
 Never wants a passerby to pass him by
 Servant to the poor, butler to the great
 Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
 Everybody's boon companion
 Everybody's chaperone

 Thenardier
 But lock up your valises
 Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!

 Enter Monsieur, lay down your load
 Unlace your boots, rest from the road
 This weighs a ton, travel's a curse
 But here we strive to lighten your purse
 Here the goose is cooked
 Here the fat is fried
 And nothing's overlooked
 Till I'm satisfied

 Food beyond compare. Food beyond belief
 Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
 Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat
 Filling up the sausages with this and that
 Residents are more than welcome
 Bridal suite is occupied
 Reasonable charges
 Plus some little extras on the side!

 Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
 Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
 Here a little slice, there a little cut
 Three percent for sleeping with the window shut
 When it comes to fixing prices
 There are a lot of tricks he knows
 How it all increases, all them bits and pieces
 Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!

 Thenardier & Chorus:
 Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye
 Never wants a passerby to pass him by
 Servant to the poor, butler to the great
 Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
 Everybody's boon companion
 Gives 'em everything he's got

 Thenardier:
 Dirty bunch of geezers
 Jesus! What a sorry little lot!

 Mme. Thenardier:
 I used to dream that I would meet a prince
 But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?

 Master of the house? Isn't worth me spit!
 `Comforter, philosopher' and lifelong shit!
 Cunning little brain, regular Voltaire
 Thinks he's quite a lover but there's not much there
 What a cruel trick of nature landed me with such a louse
 God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house!

 Thenardier & Drinkers:
 Master of the house!

 Mme. Thenardier:
 Master and a half!

 Thenardier & Drinkers:
 Comforter, philosopher

 Mme. Thenardier:
 Ah, don't make me laugh!

 Thenardier & Drinkers:
 Servant to the poor, butler to the great

 Mme. Thenardier:
 Hypocrite and toady and inebriate!

 Thenardier & Drinkers:
 Everybody bless the landlord!
 Everybody bless his spouse!

 Thenardier:
 Everybody raise a glass

 Mme. Thenardier:
 Raise it up the master's arse

 All
 Everybody raise a glass to the Master of the House!
