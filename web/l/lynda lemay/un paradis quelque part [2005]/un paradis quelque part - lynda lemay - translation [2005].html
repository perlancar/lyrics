<h1>A Paradise somewhere </h1>
<p>Linda Lemay, 2005 </p>
<h2>1. is what you take myself to the seriousness </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
Is what you take myself <br>
as one takes a taxicab <br>
Because he/it is time <br>
that he/it passed midnight <br>
Is what you drink myself <br>
as one drinks a whisky <br>
Because he/it is cold <br>
Because that stunned you <br>
That is what tells of it to you <br>
<br>
Is what you take myself to the seriousness <br>
Or is what you take myself for a silly <br>
When I take myself to your game <br>
And that I take myself feet in your door <br>
<br>
Is what you take myself <br>
As one takes the sun <br>
When the spring <br>
Jète the winter in the sleep <br>
Is what you look for me <br>
As one looks for the silence <br>
Is that that your manger <br>
is full of children who dance <br>
That is what tells of it to you <br>
<br>
Is what you take myself in your layer <br>
As one takes a sweet to the honey <br>
To change the taste in your mouth <br>
because lied you too much to your beautiful <br>
That is what tells of it to you <br>
For that you take myself <br>
Say me for whom? say me <br>
<br>
Is what you take myself serious aqu <br>
Or is what you take myself for a silly <br>
When I take myself to your game <br>
that I surprise myself to lick you boots <br>
<br>
Is what you take myself to the seriousness <br>
Can be that one day you will tell it to me <br>
But while silent t'es <br>
Say, is what you would take myself in your arms </p>
<h2>2. me t'ai not sensible </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
I already had gonfflé my breasts <br>
For your p't'ite plugs to feed <br>
Me I was sure that were you well <br>
That t'avais not desire to leave <br>
<br>
I already had gonfflé my corp <br>
So that t'es not of pain to grow <br>
Me I was sure that were you strong <br>
me t'ai not sensible to die <br>
<br>
Me I was sure that my children <br>
Would not have hunger, nor pain, nor cold <br>
Same not the time to shout mom <br>
That I would have had them in my arms <br>
<br>
I don't even know if had you fear <br>
Me tai let all only to suffer <br>
Is what it is because I don't have a heart <br>
That j'tai not sensible to die </p>
<h2>3. a paradise somewhere </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise somewhere <br>
A world to the shelter of the world <br>
Where it never rains in looks <br>
Where there is never voice that roars <br>
<br>
A world except that I will find <br>
Maybe by dint of to dream some <br>
A beautiful history that I will tell <br>
To my children, on time to edge them <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise somewhere <br>
A world to the shelter of age <br>
A place blessed more where nothing separates <br>
The young madmen and the old wise men <br>
<br>
A world except that I will forge <br>
By dint of to imagine him <br>
A beautiful history that I will make last <br>
During eternal eternities <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise and I want to see of it to you <br>
With your hairs of ebony and your smile of ivory <br>
I would be a musician and I would play on you <br>
You would be a poem in yard under my fingers <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise somewhere <br>
A world to the shelter of the time <br>
Where the tiredness doesn't come in the evening <br>
To separate the old lovers <br>
<br>
A world except that I will find <br>
Maybe by dint of to dream some <br>
A beautiful history where I would dive <br>
Head first and eyes closed <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise, and you wait me for of it <br>
You will find me pretty, you will tell me how <br>
One makes some white sheep with the gray clouds <br>
One makes good children with our remaining of life <br>
<br>
A éden to the shelter of mockeries, of judgments, <br>
There won't be anything of forbidden there won't be anything of bothersome <br>
You will tell me I like you and I will make as you <br>
You will be a poem in yard under my fingers <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise somewhere <br>
Somewhere in my brain <br>
If you came to make a tour in my hope <br>
You would see as one is beautiful <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise and I want to see of it to you <br>
With your hairs of ebony and your smile of ivory <br>
I would be a musician and I would play on you <br>
You would be a poem in yard under my fingers <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise as in novels <br>
Where you would be kind, where you would be charming <br>
He/it exists a paradise but it is a secret <br>
You in fact left but you will never know it <br>
<br>
He/it exists a paradise somewhere </p>
<h2>4. Paul-Émile has flowers </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
Let the therefore calm <br>
Let the therefore sleep <br>
Withdraw your needles <br>
Let the therefore leave <br>
<br>
It is the sky and your machines <br>
Who extricates each of their side <br>
Who is there that persists in himself <br>
It is to that will be strongest <br>
Let the therefore I swear you <br>
It is her the better <br>
She/it takes care of my injuries <br>
Better than a herd of your doctors <br>
<br>
Stop to beat you therefore <br>
Let the therefore die <br>
To withdraw your rooms paws <br>
Stop to keep it <br>
<br>
Set free veins therefore <br>
It is not your mother yours <br>
It is same pt'être more mine <br>
I recognize it at all <br>
<br>
She/it already knows by heart <br>
All ways of p'tits poems <br>
Who finishes by Amen <br>
Is necessary well that she/it sees the Lord <br>
<br>
Since the time that she/it gets ready <br>
To be beautiful for him <br>
Don't waste his/her/its departure <br>
If is necessary that it is for today <br>
<br>
Let the therefore calm <br>
Let the therefore dream <br>
She/it dreams to Paul-Emile <br>
I am persuaded some <br>
<br>
And good God what sadness <br>
See as she/it gets bored <br>
Of jokes and caress <br>
Of his/her/its Paul-Emile love <br>
<br>
Wait a little therefore <br>
Don't arrange your needles <br>
She/it won't miss to God <br>
As much as she misses to his/her/its family <br>
<br>
Don't let it calm <br>
Don't let it die out <br>
As I know Paul-Emile <br>
Y'va goes the r'joindre <br>
<br>
But resuscitate it therefore <br>
But tops therefore something <br>
Inflate him lungs <br>
Increase him his/her/its doses <br>
<br>
Raise him lids <br>
She/it has the trouille of the black <br>
Wake up my pauv'mère <br>
She/it is going to make nightmares <br>
<br>
Knock him on the heart <br>
But tops to react it <br>
Paul-Emile has flowers <br>
He/it wants to offer them to him </p>
<h2>5. cloths (Duet with Kevin Parent) </h2>
<p>Cloths against rags <br>
it is the expression in my family <br>
my brothers fight when they are hot <br>
the war explodes in one thousand pieces <br>
At home one has what one deserves <br>
one will finish the hollow stomach <br>
but is worth better late that immediately <br>
at home wolves eat themselves between them <br>
<br>
Heart that sighs eats a flight <br>
and the appetite comes while eating <br>
losque fire made not of smoke one can burn eternally <br>
the big remedies to our big pains <br>
one doesn't find them in pharmacy <br>
one himself abitue to our shortcomings <br>
who to drunk will drink, as one says. <br>
<br>
Starved stomach doesn't have an ear <br>
at home one s'entend not to say <br>
That for all the hulls gleams the sun <br>
is necessary to drink wine that dad pulls <br>
<br>
At us by luck that that sleeps dines <br>
and that that castigates likes well well <br>
one likes himself very strong in the kitchen <br>
when one only has a slice of bread <br>
<br>
All truth is good has say <br>
to beautiful to lie that leaves from here <br>
all comes has not to that knows fuire <br>
the dead end of people deprived. <br>
<br>
If it is true that to want that can <br>
I swear you that I can some has life <br>
all last, the dark sheep, <br>
are the first in my slum. <br>
<br>
And so poverty is not vice <br>
she/it is nevertheless hereditary <br>
what one hopes for father in son <br>
it is that all pain deserves salary <br>
<br>
the thick good blood in my family <br>
I believe that it is necessary to see it to drink it <br>
more one is madmen in my family <br>
more one yellow sweetbread of our fights. <br>
<br>
Starved stomach doesn't have an ear <br>
at home one s'entend not to say <br>
That for all the hulls gleams the sun <br>
is necessary to drink wine that dad pulls <br>
<br>
At us by luck that that sleeps dines <br>
and that that castigates likes well well <br>
one likes himself very strong in the kitchen <br>
when one only has a slice of bread <br>
<br>
All truth is good has say <br>
to beautiful to lie that leaves from here <br>
all comes has has not that knows fuire <br>
the dead end of people deprived. <br>
<br>
If it is true that to want that can <br>
I swear you that I can some has life <br>
all last, the dark sheep, <br>
are the first in my slum. <br>
<br>
Cloths against rags <br>
it is the expression in my family <br>
my brothers fight when they are hot <br>
the war explodes in one thousand pieces <br>
<br>
Y'en has that say such father, such girl, <br>
and all is well that finishes well <br>
but the expression in my family <br>
it is when are you nothing.... you finish nothing! <br>
<br>
Starved stomach doesn't have an ear <br>
at home one s'entend not to say <br>
That for all the hulls gleams the sun <br>
is necessary to drink wine that dad pulls <br>
<br>
At us by luck that that sleeps dines <br>
and that that castigates likes well well <br>
one likes himself very strong in the kitchen <br>
when one only has a slice of bread <br>
<br>
All truth is good has say <br>
to beautiful to lie that leaves from here <br>
all comes to point has that knows fuire <br>
the dead end of people deprived. <br>
<br>
At home one doesn't have means that I am hungry that justifies him <br>
If it is true the time that is the hay <br>
I have a mean shoes credit. </p>
<h2>6. one rows you </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
More and more old <br>
You make yourself more and more old <br>
One always recovers you in pieces <br>
Of wakening in wakening <br>
Of bottle in bottle <br>
<br>
One rows you and you fall again <br>
Even more hollow every time <br>
And you forget that one is all <br>
And you appear even older every time <br>
And you forget that one is all <br>
<br>
More and more hard <br>
Ho yes it is besides harder e <br>
Of poserles eyes on your shreds <br>
Of somersault in somersault <br>
Of relapse in relapse <br>
<br>
One you rammasse and you fall again <br>
Even more hollow every time <br>
And you forget that one is all <br>
And you appear even older every time <br>
And you forget that one is all <br>
<br>
One doesn't stop wanting <br>
To want has your room <br>
to want trust you <br>
to want that you find a new job <br>
<br>
To see to be held right <br>
Of evening in evening once for all <br>
One doesn't stop believing of it <br>
While are you the that you doubt <br>
<br>
More and more fear <br>
Yes one is afraid more and more <br>
To find again one day on the back <br>
Left in journey <br>
Gray like a cloud that knew to not cry <br>
Of course dad your pride in pieces <br>
One will collect it <br>
<br>
And you forget that one is all for you... </p>
<h2>7. the good widower </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
The head between two gray temples <br>
And two very tight jaws <br>
Nevertheless elegant in his/her/its ch'mise <br>
A badly ironed trifle <br>
Because the poor doesn't have anybody anymore <br>
Nor to the attic, nor in kitchen <br>
To play the amante and the good <br>
Of a soft and feminine hand <br>
<br>
He/it walks his/her/its forty <br>
With the honor to be again <br>
That a survivor of this pain <br>
That can cause the death only <br>
He/it walks his/her/its impotence <br>
Of unjustly free husband <br>
Obliged to purge like sentence <br>
A perpetual horrible absence <br>
<br>
He/it nearly leaves the cheek humid <br>
And pleasantly nearly shaven <br>
Of a step strong apparement <br>
And that one supposes shaken <br>
To the small coffee of the village <br>
Or hurry has comfort it <br>
Of pleasant face heaps <br>
To the large devoted sourir <br>
<br>
More he/it unpacks his/her/its history <br>
More the charmed damsels <br>
Agglutinate themselves, come himself assoir <br>
Close to the big uprooted <br>
Who as genealogy <br>
Seem to only count a branch <br>
The one fall, of his/her/its love, <br>
Of his/her/its defunct, of his/her/its angel, <br>
<br>
What more attractive than a good widower <br>
For that a new life begins <br>
Who to have a new heart <br>
To the heart washed by the silence <br>
Of the one that sleeps the enclosed mouth <br>
With the full secrets the coffin <br>
And a dozen of red pink <br>
That he/it pricked him in the pride <br>
<br>
Before closing the lid <br>
Before the sorry crowd <br>
Who seemed to choke with <br>
An excessive sympathy <br>
What more attractive than a good guy <br>
All déblanchit of all suspicions <br>
Ex-husbands one respects them <br>
Especially in mourning, and in jacket <br>
<br>
And it is the head between two boards <br>
And well cemented two jaws <br>
That the p'tite packs down all half note <br>
That one has all endimanchée <br>
Before putting it in his/her/its hole <br>
And of l'ensevelir of this earth <br>
Of which she/it owes the shovelful first <br>
To his/her/its blameless spouse <br>
<br>
Yes it is the head under a stone <br>
And the back gnawed until the bone <br>
That she/it lets his/her/its good husband make <br>
The praise of their if just marriages <br>
And their innachevé marriage <br>
For which many villagers <br>
Apply for fire to the bodice <br>
And the beautiful face in ecstasy <br>
<br>
Of course him the praise <br>
His/her/its beautiful dead well beloved <br>
Since she/it changed herself/itself in angel <br>
And in speed, and in smoke <br>
Ever no one will know <br>
That their love beat the wing <br>
The dead is saved by the sky <br>
The widower is saved by the knell </p>
<h2>8. Mr. Marchand </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
I feel it to approach <br>
With his/her/its instrument <br>
Of it doesn't order me constrained <br>
«Go open of it big» <br>
<br>
And to say that it is mom <br>
Who told me of v'nir here <br>
«You are going to see Me sieur Merchant <br>
He/it is very very kind» <br>
<br>
I vibrate under the noise <br>
Of the electric drill <br>
That he/it passes me through <br>
Of a rotted molar <br>
<br>
I give out some p'titses screaming <br>
I have the uvula that panics <br>
I have the language of shortcoming <br>
Covered of saw sprigs <br>
<br>
V'la the good that brings himself <br>
With the vacuum cleaner <br>
In full muzzle matter <br>
I am crowned queen <br>
<br>
It is besides a crown <br>
That she/it told me that that took me <br>
The handmaid of the without cur <br>
While inhaling me the palace <br>
<br>
I see on the right on the table <br>
That that can be undoubtedly <br>
That l'attirail of torture <br>
Of a stamped psychopath <br>
<br>
I don't feel my face anymore <br>
He/it injected me too much <br>
Of his/her/its poison the wild <br>
He/it disfigured me <br>
<br>
Soudain'ment slackens of it <br>
So that I go to the sink <br>
So that I rinse and that I spit <br>
What permits me to verify <br>
<br>
The just mirror above <br>
Confirms me what I fear <br>
My mouth doesn't answer anymore <br>
I am Lynda Christian <br>
<br>
I try to run away <br>
But my executioner catches up me <br>
«One have finish» <br>
Of it sends back me under the tablecloth <br>
<br>
That was not able to êt'pire <br>
As ambiance of terror <br>
I was cold in the spine <br>
I lived the top of the horror <br>
<br>
Until in mute <br>
As coming of anywhere <br>
Y'a Herbert Léonard <br>
Who sings «For the pleasure» <br>
<br>
And that my big denies <br>
Takes out another accessory <br>
Kind sandblasting machine to cement <br>
Démancheuse of jaw <br>
<br>
The r'voilà to work <br>
Bad I swear you that applies there <br>
And there r'vole of the enamel <br>
In sadist's face <br>
<br>
I have been sequestrated <br>
Condemned has the chair <br>
Mutilated, slaughtered <br>
Tortured not his/her/its strawberry <br>
<br>
I left like a rag <br>
When one freed me <br>
Again in state of shock <br>
I paid submissively <br>
<br>
In the hand for the tartar <br>
A brush has green tooth <br>
That the good woman offered me <br>
While smiling like a pie <br>
<br>
I can took the elevator <br>
Or I tried well <br>
To put back the color <br>
On my baboune enfflée <br>
<br>
I have make that well that I was able to <br>
I put several layers of it <br>
I put some more or less <br>
Everywhere except on the mouth <br>
<br>
And instead of to succeed <br>
To cute parraitre <br>
I seemed to come out again <br>
Of the clinton office <br>
<br>
Can be that Monica <br>
Was frozen of machoîreses <br>
Since it is by the stocking <br>
That she/it smoked cigars! <br>
<br>
Today when I see <br>
A denture in one glass <br>
I ask has speak <br>
To the happy holder <br>
<br>
And then all toothless <br>
That either l&quot;humble big mother <br>
I surprise myself to envy <br>
His/her/its gums all smooth. <br>
<br>
And I tell him all stocking <br>
Don't fear the hell <br>
He/it only exists here low <br>
And I lived him Previously <br>
<br>
If ever your vicars <br>
describes you Lucifer <br>
They won't tell you <br>
That he/it disguises himself/itself in dentist </p>
<h2>9. that is what one is going to become my man </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
One permitted itself so much of evenings <br>
One promised itself so much of years <br>
One sang himself so much of apples <br>
That is what one is going to become my man <br>
<br>
One had imagined <br>
That can be with the time <br>
Our two hands himself scratches themselves worn-out <br>
Himself scratches themselves melted and welded <br>
<br>
One filled itself so much of plate <br>
One rose glasses so much <br>
One calmed itself so much of angers <br>
While shouting itself/themselves that one was silly <br>
<br>
One permitted itself so much of feasts <br>
And one made himself so much of friends <br>
Without counting the tête-à-tête <br>
And body-have-bodies to the bed <br>
<br>
That is this qu'on is going to become my man <br>
TER <br>
<br>
One got drunk the muzzle so much <br>
One is himself enguelé that is true <br>
But one never thought <br>
That one was going to finish all only <br>
With reproaches to make <br>
With nearly same of harms <br>
With nearly of remorses <br>
And a bitter arriere-gôut <br>
<br>
One gave himself bottles <br>
To ever to clear <br>
But that one cleared the vigil <br>
Of the opportunity to celebrate <br>
<br>
One looked closely at himself <br>
To the full day and one liked himself <br>
One liked words that remain <br>
One liked the same gestures <br>
<br>
That is this qu'on is going to become my man <br>
TER <br>
<br>
One foresaw itself so much of journeys <br>
One didn't carry on the ground <br>
One gîtait on clouds <br>
Or some sides of sea <br>
<br>
That is this qu'on is going to become my man <br>
With our intimate souv'nirses <br>
Who would have made sodome <br>
And it is not that for the rhyme <br>
<br>
Yes one promised itself so <br>
Of everything that is not real <br>
That our sky tarnished <br>
One is unfaithful dev'nu <br>
<br>
Or is the tower of Babel <br>
Or are those that constructed her <br>
It is not you, it is not Effeil <br>
Or is God that I avoid him. <br>
<br>
If it is he with his/her/its tower <br>
Who only wants one understands himself <br>
If it is God and his/her/its love <br>
Who wants that the our dies out <br>
<br>
That is this qu'on is going to become my man <br>
That is this qu'on became my man </p>
<h2>10. My paths to the back </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
After having flown <br>
And makes a tour of the complete world <br>
After having searched <br>
The heart of all secret men <br>
After having dragged my soles <br>
On the most beautiful mountains <br>
It is here that I will come back <br>
<br>
I will come back to the side <br>
Of a stream that I adore <br>
I would put down my eyes <br>
On his/her/its big blue stomach <br>
Here trees have moods <br>
Change of it of color head <br>
It is here that the lawn smells like my childhood <br>
That blackbirds make the biggest nests <br>
Yes it is here that all begins and that all finishes <br>
That all finishes <br>
<br>
After having gotten drunk <br>
Of the most vibrant poetry <br>
After having tasted <br>
The most violent spices <br>
And understood all laces <br>
Of the most sensual languages <br>
Of is here that I would come back <br>
<br>
I will come back to the side <br>
Of a stream that I adore <br>

And that all finishes <br>

All mysteries, all borders, <br>
I would redo my paths has the back <br>

Change of it of color head <br>
It is here that the lawn smells like my childhood <br>
That blackbirds make the biggest nests <br>
Yes it is here that all begins <br>
And that all finishes <br>
That all finishes </p>
<h2>11. Where were you </h2>

I will put your photos on my wall <br>
I will put your sweaters on my foot of bed <br>
And all my impure reflections <br>

You that I waited <br>
so many years <br>
These years that I lost, lost <br>
<br>
With versions of husbands <br>
With bodies that I liked well <br>
But that don't have their life never <br>
been yours <br>
<br>
I will put your photos on my wall <br>
for you in truth to laugh I would tell yourself that me l'ai makes <br>
you when you laugh that procures me <br>
you can not imagine what effect <br>
I will put your laughter in my memory <br>
and can I would leave to fall. <br>
Of course I am too old <br>
I don't live anymore in the good region <br>
the one of your lightning sun <br>
the one of your faraway generation <br>
and while admiring your portraits <br>
I would live a small discreet mourning <br>
<br>
Where were you? <br>
You that I waited <br>
so many years <br>
These years that I have <br>
<br>
Where were you? <br>
You that I waited <br>
So many years <br>
These years that I have of too much </p>
<h2>12. I deceive you </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
I deceive you with the empty evenings <br>
I deceive you with the simple beds <br>
I deceive you with this elevator that climbs me <br>
I deceive you with my suitcases, <br>
with my suitcases <br>
I deceive you with the gray evenings <br>
I deceive you with coins blacks <br>
I deceive you with dreams of piastres and glory <br>
I deceive you with my pinard, <br>
with my pinard <br>
<br>
I deceive you as me enfûmant the mind <br>
I deceive you with gypsies, humph humph <br>
I deceive you with my first 5 or 10 fans <br>
I deceive you with appetite <br>
I deceive you more and more strong <br>
I deceive you with pleasure <br>
I deceive you and phone you to tell it to you <br>
Again at the end of fingers prints dug of desire <br>
Again at the end of fingers prints dug of desire <br>
I deceive you with my guitar <br>
<br>
I deceive you with the long evenings <br>
I deceive you with rigor <br>
Yes I scrape tone rival of the tip of my nails <br>
I deceive you vigorously <br>
I deceive you and phone you for you in card <br>
I deceive you with my guitar <br>
I deceive you with my pinard <br>
<br>
Prints dug of desire <br>
With pleasure </p>
<h2>13. Ducks </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
There were ducks <br>
A thick and full of kids <br>
It was so beautiful to see the after noon <br>
The lake like a mirror <br>
Slipped them under feathers <br>
There were ducks <br>
That day, I presume <br>
<br>
One watched them so much <br>
Leaned on our strand <br>
A dry foot, a wet, <br>
One éssayait to follow them <br>
Five hours of l'après noon <br>
Without mistake they arrived <br>
The thick and kids <br>
Who the tallonnaient <br>
<br>
There was the duck <br>
Finally, I didn't see them <br>
But this day the I swear you <br>
That they came <br>
They have strutting about <br>
They have to make it the beautiful <br>
To spin between the embankment <br>
And the boat <br>
<br>
It was a beautiful Saturday <br>
The chalet was crammed <br>
When five hours of l'après noon sounded <br>
The time to light the oven <br>
Destined to pizzas <br>
The time I assure you <br>
As short as that <br>
<br>
Five hours had passed <br>
Of hardly some seconds <br>
That seemed to happen well for all my world <br>
I didn't see ducks <br>
Nor the thick, nor kids <br>
To float on the mirror <br>
That hid me my friends <br>
<br>
I only saw a coat <br>
Who floated like an algae <br>
A p'tit pale blue coat on waves <br>
Surely that ducks <br>
Deserved luck <br>
To tell to him goodbye <br>
While offering him a dance <br>
<br>
There were ducks <br>
A thick and full of kids <br>
If it doesn't say nothing about those ducks, I tell him to you <br>
One could drink tranquiles <br>
The apéro on the embankment <br>
And again to see mathilde to have fun <br>
<br>
Yes it is ducks <br>
Who removed him to me <br>
With their thick family <br>
And me me n'avais that a girl <br>
And me I don't have anything make <br>
To part not to see it <br>
And to take out the chalet <br>
... too late </p>
<h2>14. Pain of air </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
First class, it is marvelous <br>
Champagne flows like a river <br>
Stewardesses and hoteuxes <br>
arrange my jacket and all my business <br>
attach your belt! <br>
that they tell us before the takeoff <br>
keep it, just to be sure, <br>
given back to the even over of clouds <br>
<br>
One looks at unfolding it <br>
who shows a plane to dish stomach <br>
lain down on an ocean <br>
I am not really sure that that tempts me <br>
one passes a sneaky gesture <br>
a p'tite hand below our seat <br>
v'l'a our respective float <br>
well certain that that protects us <br>
<br>
Me r'garde the neighbor's face <br>
when I discover an odor of gas <br>
to say that c't'à him that j'vais to hold the hand <br>
if ever the apapreil collapses <br>
<br>
Ho no! too late of it saw me <br>
there I feel him that stares me <br>
I lower the head in my magazine <br>
Merde! I hear him that hires <br>
A beautiful conversation <br>
was necessary that me tombs on a sociable <br>
a plump kind boy <br>
a great mate <br>
who makes go his/her/its babineses <br>
of young dynamic setting <br>
who works for a factory <br>
of computer material <br>
<br>
I am tired, I hurt in the neck <br>
by dint of to nod the head <br>
I say ha yeah, bad I say that is cooool <br>
bad me m'enligne toward toilets. <br>
It is the that all of a stroke that brews <br>
that turbulle, that doesn't have a pace <br>

that me ratache my belt <br>
That me r'trouves my thick thick <br>
who continuous his/her/its torture <br>
to come back to what I said <br>

<br>
This as is too much, I glue myself a gin <br>

a boy that has the jasette well <br>
with him at the end of one hour <br>

one bails pain of heart <br>
that is not the to the pain of air <br>
To the opposite to be straightforward <br>
in his/her/its company stressante <br>
one dreams that motors quit <br>
one prays so that the plane plants itself </p>
<h2>15. The old man and the scatter-brained person </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
He/it kisses thousand of cigarettes one by one <br>
This old man in costume that tells you of nonsenses <br>
Who bends and that inhales his/her/its pinard of Burgundy <br>
This old man that you enfûmes without no shame <br>
<br>
He/it launches has himself the throat of bottles without messages <br>
And his/her/its breath overflows of bitterness and rage <br>
He/it leaves to your source to wet his/her/its low tide <br>
He/it waves you my soft like a trophy of hunting <br>
<br>
HE/IT will have made the tour of his/her/its clock soon <br>
it is the froth to the palace that him you ments of praises <br>
Him polue your youth, he/it crushes you the hand <br>
Guides you without sharpness toward eyes of buddies <br>
<br>
Him dégueule on roofs that he/it finds you marvelous <br>
But y'a that you that believe of it, you believe yourself in love <br>
Small scatter-brained person, it is very lost pain <br>
One can not like someone that doesn't like himself anymore <br>
<br>
As there is not any more joy in his/her/its poor carcass <br>
He/it only explodes voice to occupy the space <br>
A cavernous voice, a voice of besides tomb <br>
To tenderness ideuse to which you succumb <br>
<br>
No satisfied already to be full of him even <br>
Him imbuse of toi,te lets believe that you like him <br>
He/it already uses of a renown fall in crumbs <br>
In fact of the gunpowder bought to your eyes of bichette <br>
<br>
He/it lost his/her/its flame, he/it lost his/her/its wife <br>
If he/it now moves back on you, my beautiful child, <br>
If he/it dares to be going to beach itself/themselves of all his/her/its skin 
rèche <br>
His/her/its shaven muzzle pain against your skin of fishing <br>
<br>
It is that he/it doesn't have anymore as him a remaining of scruple <br>
He/it believes himself/itself all authorized, covers himself of ridicule <br>
You believe yourself enamored, but you are not nothing at all <br>
Small scatter-brained person this man is an old madman. <br>
<br>
Him himself ennivre one instant of tone pretty smile <br>
Of it makes yourself of compliments that don't want anything to say <br>
He/it envies your future, he/it begs yourself a part of it <br>
To stop itself/themselves from rotting, but it is already too late <br>
<br>
And when you permit him of carresser your thighs <br>
That only gives back it uglier, that only gives back it sadder <br>
You believe it in love, but God that you are wrong <br>
This man is not that old, this man already died </p>
<h2>16. How want you that I know </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
And if, if it was true this qu'y say me by the way <br>
That I am not put back of my bad state <br>
That if you came back I would open yourself arms <br>
And if, if it was true this qu'y say in my back <br>
That I disguise myself in happiness a little thick <br>
<br>
But that to the bottom I have the heart like a tomb. <br>
And if, if it was true this qu'y say a little everywhere <br>
That j'ai not taken the time to darn my holes <br>
That j'vais to take cold to the first appointment <br>
<br>
I can not know <br>
Since didn't come back you to see me <br>
How want you that I know <br>
What my old heart hides me <br>
<br>
And if, if it was true, this qu'y says has my topic <br>
That I am not as strong as I parrais <br>
That I tremble like a door without latch <br>
And if, if it was true that j'ai the soul like a rag <br>
Who wiped humiliation so much <br>
<br>
That she/it tears herself/itself to the least torsion <br>
And if, and if they were true all his/her/its rumors <br>
That I would take yourself if you came back in tears <br>
That I would succumb to the first bouquet of flowers <br>
<br>
I can not know <br>
Since didn't come back you to see me <br>
How want you that I know <br>
What my old heart hides me <br>
<br>
I can not know <br>
Since didn't come back you to see me <br>
How want you that I know <br>
What my old heart hides me </p>
<h2>Bonus: I am 38 years old </h2>
<p>Words: Lynda Lemay <br>
<br>
I brought up staircases <br>
and given back to the last marches <br>
a few red and breathless <br>
what is normal that that I know <br>
of the top of my 38 years <br>
I have say while exaggerating <br>
ouf! it is on that to 40 years, one doesn't have the shape of before! <br>
<br>
I didn't hear a laughter <br>
on all the floor, not a his/her/its <br>
that of conses in the process of m'offrir <br>
their nod of approval. <br>
<br>
But that wants to say that if.. <br>
they didn't react <br>
while learning my age <br>
in r'gardant my face <br>
believed of it without problem <br>
to my full forty <br>
to an advanced age <br>
marked well, sounded well. <br>
<br>
Me I don't know me m'attendais <br>
