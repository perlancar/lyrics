Shawty's love is like a pyramid
 We stand together 'til the very end
 There'll never be another love for sure
 Iyaz and Charice let we go

 Stones
 Heavy like the love you've shown
 Solid as the ground we've known
 And I just wanna carry on

 We took it from the bottom up
 And even in a desert storm
 Sturdy as a rock, we hold
 Wishing every moment froze

 Now I just wanna let you know
 Earthquakes can't shake us
 Cyclones can't break us
 Hurricanes can't take away our love

 Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
 It feels just like it's heaven's touch
 Together at the top
 (At the top, baby)
 Like a pyramid

 And even when the wind is blowing
 We'll never fall, just keep on going
 Forever we will stay
 Like a pyramid

 Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
 Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
 Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey

 Cold, never ever when you're close
 We will never let it fold
 A story that was never told
 Something like a mystery

 And every step we took we've grown
 Look how fast the time has flown
 A journey to a place unknown
 We're going down in history

 Earthquakes can't shake us
 Cyclones can't break us
 Hurricanes can't take away our love

 Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
 It feels just like it's heaven's touch
 Together at the top
 (At the top, baby)
 Like a pyramid

 And even when the wind is blowing
 We'll never fall, just keep it going
 Forever we will stay
 Like a pyramid

 Like a pyramid, girl, l'mma show you
 That I love you so much, that we gonna get through
 Even when it storms, I will never go
 I'mma be the one to keep you safe, hey

 Four walls and love, packin' more than enough
 Holding on to one another, be the cover when it's rough
 Mother nature or disaster
 Won't stop our happy ever after

 Pyramid, keep it going
 (Like a pyramid, like a pyramid)
 Whoa
 (Like a pyramid, like a pyramid)

 Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
 It feels just like it's heaven's touch
 Together at the top
 (At the top, baby)
 Like a pyramid

 And even when the wind is blowing
 We'll never fall, just keep on going
 Forever we will stay
 Like a pyramid

 We built this on a solid rock
 It feels just like it's heaven's touch
 Together at the top
 (At the top, baby, at the top)
 Like a pyramid

 And even when the wind is blowing
 We'll never fall, just keep it going
 Forever we will stay
 Like a pyramid

 Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
 Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, yeah
 Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey
