[Verse 1]
 I may not know where I'm going now
 This broken road is trying to tear me down
 But deep inside I've found a secret place, that I never knew where I feel safe, when the world is untrue 
 Here's what I've learned to do

[Chorus]
 Just sing this song and it takes me right back
 Where I belong
 Everyday there's a new bridge to cross
 But I'm never far from home
 If I put my heart, my soul, my all
 In this song

[Verse 2]
 I don't depend on friends
 Cuz they come and go
 My belief in myself
 Is gonna carry me through
 And that why I'm learning, oh, I learning yeah, I'm learning to sing

[Chorus]
 Just sing this song and it takes me right back
 Where I belong
 Everyday there's a new bridge to cross
 But I'm never far from home
 If I put my heart, my soul, my all
 In this song

[Chorus]
 Just sing this song and it takes me right back
 Where I belong
 Everyday there's a new bridge to cross
 But I'm never far from home
 If I put my heart, my soul, my all...

[Bridge]
 I may not have all the words that I need to say, and I know I won't always be strong but I'm never araid
 Because I hold my destiny and it depends on me alone, alone so...

[Chorus]
 Just sing this song and it takes me right back
 Where I belong
 Everyday there's a new bridge to cross
 But I'm never far from home
 If I put my heart, my soul, my all
 In this song

[Chorus]
 Just sing this song and it takes me right back
 Where I belong
 Everyday there's a new bridge to cross
 But I'm never far from home
 If I put my heart, my soul, my all...
 I'll keep putting my heart, my soul, my all
 In this song
 In this song
 In this song
