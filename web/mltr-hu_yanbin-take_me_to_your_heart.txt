MLTR HU YANBIN LYRICS
 Hiding from The Rain and Snow
 Trying to forget but I won't let go
 Looking at a crowded street
 Listening to my own heart beat

 So many people all around the world
 Tell me where do I find someone like you girl

 总在刹那间有一些了解
 说过的话不可能曾实现
 就在一转眼发现你的脸
 已经陌生不曾再像从前
 我的世界开始下雪
 冷得让我无法多爱一天
 冷得连隐藏的遗憾都那么地明显

 Take me to your heart take me to your soul
 Give me your hand and hold me
 Show me what love is - be my guiding star
 It's easy take me to your heart

 前尘往事成云烟消散在彼此眼前
 就连说过了再见也看不见你有些哀怨
 给我的一切你不过是在敷衍
 你笑的越无邪我就会爱你爱得更狂野

 Take me to your heart take me to your soul
 Give me your hand before I'm old
 Show me what love is - haven't got a clue
 Show me that wonders can be true

 They say nothing lasts forever
 We're only here today
 Love is now or never
 Bring me far away

 Take me to your heart take me to your soul
 Give me your hand and hold me
 Show me what love is - be my guiding star
 It's easy take me to your heart

 Take me to your heart take me to your soul
 Give me your hand and hold me
 Show me what love is - be my guiding star
 It's easy take me to your heart
