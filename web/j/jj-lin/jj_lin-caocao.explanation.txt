曹操不罗嗦,一心要那荆州
 Cao2 cao1 bu4 luo1 suo1, yi4 xin1 yao4 na2 jing1 zhou1
 Cao Cao was not a wordy person. All he wanted is to acquire the Prefecture of Jing.

 er2 nu3 qing2 chang2 bei4 luan4 shi4 zuo3 you4, you3 shui2 lai2 zhu3 jiu3

 er3 yu2 wo3 zha4 shi4 san1 guo2, shuo1 bu4 qing1 dui4 yu3 cuo4
 Mutual deception is the Three Kingdoms, and it is hard to clearly declare who was right or who was wrong.

纷纷扰扰千百年以后,一切又从头
