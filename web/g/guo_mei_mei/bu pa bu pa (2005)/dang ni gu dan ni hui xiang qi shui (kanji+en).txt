当你孤单你会想起谁
When You Are Lonely, Who Will You Think Of

你的心情总在飞 什么事都要去追 想抓住一点安慰
You are always moody and you try to pursue all matters, wanting to hold on to some comfort
你总是喜欢在人群中徘徊 你最害怕孤单的滋味
You like to walk in the middle of crowds because you're scared of being lonely
你的心那么脆 一碰就会碎 经不起一点风吹
Your heart is so fragile it will break with only a touch - it cannot fight against the wind
你的身边总是要许多人陪 你最害怕每天的天黑
You always need people to stay by your side, because you're afraid of the daily darkness

但是天总会黑 人总要离别
But there are times when the sky will turn dark, and people will have to leave
谁也不能永远陪谁
There isn't anyone who can accompany another person forever
而孤单的  谁都要面对
And the feeling of being lonely is something everyone must face
不只是你我会感觉到疲惫
It not only exhausts you but it tires me as well

当你孤单你会想起谁
When you are lonely, who will you think of?
你想不想找个人来陪
Do you want someone to accompany you?
你的快乐伤悲 只有我能体会
Your happiness and sorrow can only be felt by me
让我再陪你走一回
So let me be with you for a while
