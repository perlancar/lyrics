Lyrics: Like Mice Love Rice
歌手: 杨臣刚 专辑: 老鼠爱大米
Artist: Yang Chengang; Edition: Like Mice Love Rice

我听见你的声音
When I hear your voice
有种特别的感觉
I get a special kind of feeling,
让我不断想不敢再忘记你
It makes me continually think that I don't dare forget you again.
我记得有一个人
I'll always remember that there's a person
永远留在我心中
Who will stay in my heart forever,
哪怕只能够这样的想你
Even if I can only long for you this way.
如果真的有一天
But if there really comes a day
爱情理想会实现
When this love becomes a reality,
我会加倍努力好好对你永远不改变
I will redouble my efforts to be true to you.
不管路有多么远
No matter how long the road
一定会让它实现
I will surely make this love come true.
我会轻轻在你耳边对你说(对你说)
I'll lean close to your ear, and gently say to you,
我爱你爱着你
"I love you, I'm loving you
就像 老鼠爱大米
Just like mice love rice.
不管有多少风雨我都会依然陪着你
No matter how many difficulties may come, I will still accompany you.
我想你想着你
I miss you, I'm missing you,
不管有多么的苦
No matter how bitter the way
只要能让你开心我什么都愿意
I'm willing to do anything to make you happy.
这样爱你
That's the way I'll love you."

And it repeats a significant portion again.
