Do you have some time for me?  
Then I sing a song for you  
From 99 balloons  
On her/its/their way to the horizon.  
Do you think grad' of me maybe?  
Then I sing a song for you  
From 99 balloons  
And that sowas of sowas comes.  
  
  
99 balloons  
On her/its/their way to the horizon  
One considered as Ufo's from the universe.  
A general sent about it  
' ne squadron after,  
, To give alarm, wenn's so wär'.  
With it war'n there at the horizon  
Only 99 balloons.  
  
  
99 jet-planes,  
Everyone was a big warrior,  
Kirk lasted for Captain.  
That gave a big firework.  
The neighbors have gathered nothing  
And feel put on like itself.  
With it, one shot at the horizon  
On 99 balloons.  
  
  
99 war-secretaries,  
Match and gas cans,  
Kept for sly people,  
Already smelled fat loot.  
Called war and wanted power.  
One, whoever would have thought that,  
That it comes once generally  
Because of 99 balloons,  
  
Because of 99 balloons,  
  
99 balloons...  
  
  
99 years of war  
Left no place for winners.  
War-secretary Gibt's no longer  
And also no jet-planes.  
Today zieh' I means rounds,  
Seh' the world in debris lies.  
Hab' ' nen balloon found,  
Denk' at you and lass' him/it flies...
