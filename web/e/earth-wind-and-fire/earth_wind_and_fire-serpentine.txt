When I see your face like the morning sun you spark me to shine
Tell all the world, my need is fulfilled and that's a new design
As long as you're near, there is no fear of a victory
But when I'm away, influences stray my mind to disagree
I wanna see your face in the morning sun ignite my energy
The cause and effect of you has brought new meaning in my life to me

Gonna tell a story morning glory all about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell a story morning glory all about the serpentine fire

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I need to see your face like the morning sun ignite my energy
The cause and effect of you has brought new meaning in my life to me
The moments I find when I'm inclined to do my best
Negative wins when I give in and then I lose the test

Gonna tell a story morning glory all about the serpentine fire
Surely as life begun, you will as one battle with the serpentine fire

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Surely as life begun, you will as one battle with the serpentine fire
Surely as life begun, you will as one battle with the serpentine fire

Gonna tell a story morning glory all about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell a story morning glory all about the serpentine fire
