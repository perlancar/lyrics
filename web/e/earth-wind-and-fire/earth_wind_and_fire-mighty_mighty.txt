Walk around, why wear a frown?
Say, "Little people, try to put you down
What you need is a helpin' hand
All the strength, at your command"

How's ya faith? 'Cause ya faith is you
Who you kiddin', to yourself be true
Spread ya love, for a brighter day
For what ya search, you'll find a way

Hold yourself, hold yourself

We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our hearts lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from

Eagle flies, every seven days
Still cryin' the blues, all about ya pay
What ya gonna do 'bout your living thang?
Will ya make it better, or just complain?

Everyday is real, don't run from fear
'Cause better days are very near
There are times when you are bound to cry
One more time, head to the sky

Hold yourself, hold yourself

We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our hearts lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from

We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our hearts lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from

We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our hearts lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from
