Yeah, hey

When you wish upon a star
Ya dreams will take you very far, yeah
When you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah

Once you see your light so clear, hey
In the sky so very dear, yeah

You're a shining star no matter who you are
Shining bright to see what you can truly be
That you can truly be

Shining star come into view
Shine is watchful light on you, yeah
Gives you strength to carry on, yeah
Yeah make your body big and strong, yeah

On an adventure of the sun, yeah
Yeah it's all awake and just begun
Yeah, thought I had to stir the mood, yeah
That's it now I got my own, oh yeah, oh yeah

So if you find yourself in need
Why don't you listen to his words of heat
Be a child free of sin
Be some place, yes I can

You're a shining star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see what you can truly be

You're a shining star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see what you can truly be

You're a shining star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see what you can truly be

Shining star for you to see, what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see, what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see, what your life can truly be
