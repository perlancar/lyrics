You want my love and you can't deny
You know it's true but you try to hide
You turn down love like it's really bad
You can't give what you never had

Well bless your soul, you can fool a few
I know the truth, now so do you

You can't hide, I betcha
Betcha, betcha
Can't hide love, can't hide love
Well I betcha, gotta betcha
I can't hide yea, feeling inside

You can't pretend there's nothing there
Girl, I look in your eyes, see you care
So why not stop trying to run and hide
You won't find out if you never try

You want my love, I betcha
Betcha
You want my love, well I betcha
Gotta betcha
Ohh, I'ma feeling inside

Love has found the time for kissing
Can you find the time to listen?
Life found the time to bug you
Can you find the time for blessing?
