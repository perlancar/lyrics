Hearts of fire creates love desire
Take you high and higher to the world you belong
Hearts of fire creates love desire
High and higher to your place on the throne

We've come together on this special day
To sing our message loud and clear
Looking back weve touched on sorrowful days
Future pass, they disappear

You will find peace of mind
If you look way down in your heart and soul
Dont hesitate cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart cause youre never, never old at heart

That's the way of the world
Plant your flower and you grow a pearl
A child is born with a heart of gold
The way of the world makes his heart grow cold

Hearts of fire creates love desire
Take you high and higher to the world you belong
Hearts of fire, love desire
High and higher, you, you, you

Hearts of fire, love desire
High and higher

We've came together on this special day
To sing our message loud and clear
Looking back weve touched on sorrowful days
Well, future disappear

You will find peace of mind
If you look way down in your heart and soul
Dont hesitate cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart cause youre never, never, never old at heart

That's the way of the world
Plant your flowers and you grow a pearl
A child is born with a heart of gold
The way of the world makes his heart grow cold

And love, and love, and love, and love
And love, and love, and love
Well the love, the love, the love
Darlin' lovely, don't you hear me now?
Don't you hear me now?
Darlin', won't you hear me now, won't you hear me now?

Hearts of fire, love desire
High and higher, you, you, you
Hearts of fire, love desire
