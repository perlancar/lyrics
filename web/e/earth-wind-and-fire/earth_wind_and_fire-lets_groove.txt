Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove, get you to move
It's alright, alright
Let this groove, light up your fuse
So stand up, alright, alright

Gonna tell you what you can do
With my love, alright
Let you know girl, you're lookin' good
You're out of sight,you're alright

Just move yourself
And glide like a 747
And you lose yourself in the sky
Among the clouds in the Heaven

Let this groove, Get you to move
It's alright, alright, alright
Let this groove, light up your fuse
So Stand up, alright, alright

Let me tell you what you can do
With my love, alright
Gotta let you know girl you're lookin' good
You're out of sight, you're alright

Just tell the D.J.
To play your favorite tune
And you know it's okay
What you found is a happiness, now

Let this groove, get you to move
It's alright, alright, alright
Let this groove, light up your fuse
So Stand up, alright, alright

Let this groove, get you to move
It's alright, alright,alright
Let this groove, light up your fuse
So Stand up, alright, alright

You will find peace of mind on the floor
in time, come and see, you and me
Make a little sign, I'll be there in a while
If you want my love

We can boogie on down, down
Boogie on down, down
Boogie on down
We got the floor now

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove, get you to move
It's alright, alright
Let this groove, light up your fuse
So Stand up, alright, alright

Let this groove, get you to move
It's alright, alright
Let this groove, light up you fuse
SO Stand up, alright, alright

Let this groove, get you to move
It's alright, alright
Let this groove, light your fuse
So Stand up, alright, alright

Lets groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby spice it right
We're gonna grove tonight
