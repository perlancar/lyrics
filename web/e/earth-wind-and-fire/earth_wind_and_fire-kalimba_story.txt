aw it in a store one day
Thought it might make me play
Future music all for you

Seen me through my hardest times
Thought it was 'bout time
To open up a new world just for you

Fills all my needs, gave me the key
Door was open, for me to see
Playin' around the world
Touchin' all the boys and girls
With a new love to make them free

Kalimba, oh Kalimba, play me a tune
Kalimba, oh Kalimba, I'm glad I found you
Kalimba, oh Kalimba, play me a tune
Kalimba, oh Kalimba, sends a message to you

If you lend an ear and you have no fear
The vibration will move your mind
It's new to you, sounds true to you
Sacred music before it's time

Play it for you now, wanna see
Just how my Kalimba get next to you
Are you ready now, well get ready now
Come along, groove with the new

Kalimba, oh Kalimba, play me a tune
Kalimba, oh Kalimba, I'm glad I found you
Kalimba, oh Kalimba, play me a tune
Kalimba, oh Kalimba, sends a message to you

Kalimba, oh Kalimba, play me a tune
Kalimba, oh Kalimba, sends a message to you
Kalimba, oh Kalimba, sends a message to you
