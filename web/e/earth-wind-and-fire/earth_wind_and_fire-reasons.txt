Now, I'm craving your body is this real
Temperatures rising I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real

And I'm longing to love you just for a night
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you with all my might

Reasons, the reasons that we hear
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings a won't disappear

Ooh and after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all our reasons start to fade

After all the reasons why
All the reasons were a lie
After all the reasons love
And if love was left aside

Longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might
Ooh, baby

Reasons, the reasons that we hear
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings a won't disappear
They won't disappear

After the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

And, in the morning when I rise
No longer feeling hypnotized
For no reasons, our reasons
Our reasons have no pride

After all the reasons why
All of the reasons were a lie
After all the reasons were
Love was never decide

I can't find the reasons
But my love for you it won't disappear
Can't find the reasons, why I love you, my baby

Love, love, love, love
