It was Saturday nite the moon was bright shining

It was Saturday nite the moon was bright shining down as harvest light
Music all around to hear set the stage an atmosphere
Many dress to suit their taste participate in the ego race
Tonite's the night for you to be biggest man in history
Saturday nite's your curtain call you found your place after all
I saw a face now in the crowd sayin' nothin' talking loud

Life is just a day living games we play
London Bridge is fallin' down do what Simon says
Doing what you feel games can be unreal
Humpty Dumpty when you fall there be no one here to call
Life is stil your mystery you see you see you see

Many friends who gather 'round in hope to feel safe and sound
We emphasize to make it clear our stumbling nations atmosphere
While looking through the looking glass our vision show a stormy past
When you gonna wake an' see the sun you just wasting time and having fun

Life is just a day daily games you play
London bridge has fallen down you did what Simon said
Doing what you feel games are so unreal
Humpty Dumpty why'd you fall you see there's no one here to call
Now we've solved this mystery you see you see you see

Doing what you feel be unreal life is just a day
Life is stil a mystery daily games we play

What you gonna do when the night is blue
When the cloud is gone and your dream is true
