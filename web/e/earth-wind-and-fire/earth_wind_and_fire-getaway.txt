Getaway
Just leave today
Just getaway

So you say you tried but you just can't find the pleasure
People around you givin' you pressure
Try to resist all the hurt that's all around you
If you taste it, it will haunt you

So come, take me by the hand
We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can
I know we can, I know we can

Getaway
Just leave today
Just getaway

Watch for the signs that lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way into what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating

So come, take me by the hand
We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can getaway
Getaway

Lay awake every night till the sun comes up in the morning
Nothing exciting, it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
To your road, you just don't doubt it

So come, take me by the hand
We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can
I know we can, I know we can

Getaway
Just leave today
Just getaway
Just leave today
Just getaway

Just getaway
Just leave today
Just getaway

Getaway, leave today
Getaway, yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Getaway, leave today
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah
