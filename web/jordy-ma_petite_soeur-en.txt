Jordy, Jordy, mommy's gone
Take care of daddy and if you behave yourself
You'll get a big present
Big kisses, honey, I love you

Hey, Daddy, why did mommy leave?
I want her to come back
Hey, Daddy, what's my big present?
You mean a little sister? Hooray!
I want to see her, I want to see her, la, la, la
I want to see her, I want to see her, la, la, la
Will mommy still take care of me?
Will she still love me, love me like before?
Hey, Dad, is my little sister pretty?
Can I pick her up?
Hey, Dad, what's her name? Will I take her to school
Will she play with me, I want to see her, I want to see her
La, la, la...

I can't sleep, Dad
I just can't
I want mommy to come and sing me a song
Can you call her so I can sleep?
Hello, hello, Mommy?
Hello, my baby
Is that my little sister crying, mommy?
Yes, darling, it's normal, you know
She's so tiny and beautiful

She looks like you
Really!
She has your eyes
Listen, it's time you went to bed
OK, Mommy, will you sing me a song?

Sleep, sleep, baby, sleep, I love you so
Sleep, sleep, baby, sleep, hush now, I adore you
Sleep, sleep, baby, sleep, I love you so

Me, too, Mommy
Good night, baby
Good night, Mommy
